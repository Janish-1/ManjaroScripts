XAMPP is now installed below the /opt/lampp directory.

To start, stop or restart XAMPP simply call the command

    sudo xampp {start, stop, restart}

Alternatively you can use the `xampp` systemd service.

To check that everything really works just enter the following URL in your web
browser:

    http://localhost

Have fun!
